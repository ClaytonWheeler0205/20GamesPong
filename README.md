# 20GamesPong
A clone of pong made for [The 20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/games/pong/). The goal of this project was to learn the basics of the Godot game engine and C# to make a basic game. I used the Godot game engine due to its free and open source qualities and C# due to being my personal language of choice.
